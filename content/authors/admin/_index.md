I am a PhD student at Princeton University in computer science, working on problems in Bayesian statistics and machine learning. I am particularly interested in developing robust and scalable methods for probabilistic modeling and inference. At Princeton, I am a member of the Laboratory for Intelligent Probabilistic Systems Group and the Biological and Evolutionary Explorations using Hierarchical Integrative Statistical Models Group. Currently, I serve on the Women in Machine Learning Board of Directors. My research is generously supported by a Google PhD Fellowship in Machine Learning.
