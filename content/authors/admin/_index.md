I am a PhD student at Princeton University in Computer Science and am broadly interested in machine learning and statistics,
  with an emphasis on developing robust and reliable methods for probabilistic modeling and Bayesian inference.
At Princeton, I am advised by <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rpa/">Ryan P. Adams</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bee/">Barbara Engelhardt</a>, and I also work with <a href="http://tamarabroderick.com">Tamara Broderick</a> at MIT.
I am a member of the <a href="http://lips.cs.princeton.edu/">Laboratory for Intelligent Probabilistic Systems Group</a> and the <a href="http://beehive.cs.princeton.edu">Biological and Evolutionary Explorations using Hierarchical Integrative Statistical Models Group</a>.

Previously, I received an A.B. in Computer Science and Statistics from Harvard
University and an M.S. in Statistics from the University of Chicago.
During the summer of 2019,
I was an intern at Microsoft Research New England, where I worked with <a href="http://nicolofusi.com">Nicolo Fusi</a> and <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~lmackey/index.html">Lester Mackey</a>.
Currently, I am a member of the <a href="https://wimlworkshop.org/">Women in Machine Learning</a> <a href="https://wimlworkshop.org/board-of-directors/">Board of Directors</a>. My research is generously supported by a <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/09/announcement-of-2019-fellowship.html">Google PhD Fellowship in Machine Learning</a>.
