I am a research fellow in the [Center for Computational Mathematics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-mathematics/) at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/),
where I am a member of the [ML@CCM group](https://users.flatironinstitute.org/~lsaul/ml_ccm.html) and [ML@FI](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/machine-learning-at-the-flatiron-institute/).
I design and analyze **probabilistic machine learning methods**. I am motivated by _real-world scientific constraints_ and develop methods in close collaboration with scientists across domains, including biology, chemistry, and physics.
<!--I am broadly interested in developing robust and reliable methods for data analysis and understanding their properties.-->
<!--I'm particularly interested in probabilistic inference and uncertainty
quantification, with a focus on Bayesian methods under model misspecification, approximate inference, active learning, and
applications in science.
-->
<!--[material science](/project/materials/) and [biomedical data science](/project/biomedical/).-->

I completed a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Princeton University, where I was
advised by [Ryan Adams](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rpa/) and [Barbara Engelhardt](https://www.stanfordgladstonebeehive.com/).
I was supported in part by a [Google PhD Fellowship in Machine Learning](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/09/announcement-of-2019-fellowship.html).
Previously, I received an A.B. in Computer Science and Statistics from Harvard University, an M.S. in Statistics from the University of Chicago, and an M.A. in Computer Science from Princeton University.
<!--My work has been recognized by spotlight awards at NeurIPS and ICML, a
Princeton SEAS Applied Science Award, Rising Stars in EECS, and Rising
Stars in Machine Learning.

\ I am a member of the [Laboratory for Intelligent Probabilistic Systems Group](http://lips.cs.princeton.edu/) and the [Biological and Evolutionary Explorations using Hierarchical Integrative Statistical Models Group](http://beehive.cs.princeton.edu/).
--> <!--During the summer of 2019, I was an intern at Microsoft Research New England, where I worked with [Nicolo Fusi](http://nicolofusi.com/) and [Lester Mackey](https://web.stanford.edu/~lmackey/index.html).-->
<!--Currently, I am a member of the [Women in Machine Learning Board of Directors](https://wimlworkshop.org/board-of-directors/). -->
