I am a PhD student at Princeton University in Computer Science, advised by
[Ryan P. Adams](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rpa/) and [Barbara Engelhardt](https://gladstone.org/people/barbara-engelhardt).<!--, and I also collaborate with [Tamara Broderick](http://tamarabroderick.com/) at MIT.-->
I am a member of the [Laboratory for Intelligent Probabilistic Systems Group](http://lips.cs.princeton.edu/) and the [Biological and Evolutionary Explorations using Hierarchical Integrative Statistical Models Group](http://beehive.cs.princeton.edu/).
Previously, I received an A.B. in Computer Science and Statistics from Harvard University, an M.S. in Statistics from the University of Chicago, and an M.A. in Computer Science from Princeton University.
My research was supported by a [Google PhD Fellowship in Machine Learning](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/09/announcement-of-2019-fellowship.html).

<!--During the summer of 2019, I was an intern at Microsoft Research New England, where I worked with [Nicolo Fusi](http://nicolofusi.com/) and [Lester Mackey](https://web.stanford.edu/~lmackey/index.html).-->
<!--Currently, I am a member of the [Women in Machine Learning Board of Directors](https://wimlworkshop.org/board-of-directors/). -->

**Research interests:**
I am broadly interested in developing
robust and reliable methods for data analysis and understanding their properties.
I'm particularly interested in probabilistic inference and uncertainty
quantification, with a focus on Bayesian methods under model misspecification, approximate inference, active learning, and
applications to [material science](/project/materials/) and [biomedical data
science](/project/biomedical/).
